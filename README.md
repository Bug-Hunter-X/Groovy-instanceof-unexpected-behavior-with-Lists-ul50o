# Groovy instanceof unexpected behavior with Lists

This example demonstrates a subtle issue in Groovy when using `instanceof` with lists.  The `instanceof` operator doesn't behave as expected when checking against collection types like Lists.

The provided `bug.groovy` file contains a method that attempts to handle different data types (String, Integer, and List). However, the List is not correctly identified due to the limitations of `instanceof`. 

The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a corrected version, using the `is` operator for type checking collections which improves type checking for lists.  The `is` operator provides a more robust way to check for collection types.

## How to reproduce

1. Save the code in `bug.groovy`
2. Run the code using Groovy. 
3. Observe that the output doesn't correctly identify the List type.

## Solution

The solution utilizes Groovy's `is` operator to correctly identify the List.
